# Project Title

ERC20 Token Contract

## Description

The contract, named "MyToken," is an ERC20-compliant token with additional functionalities for minting, burning, and transferring tokens. The contract owner can mint new tokens, users can burn their tokens, and anyone can transfer tokens between accounts.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To deploy the ERC20 token contract, follow these steps:

Install a Solidity development environment such as Remix.
Compile the Solidity contract using a Solidity compiler.
Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using Remix or another deployment tool.
Once deployed, the contract owner can mint tokens using the mint function, while token holders can burn and transfer tokens using the burn and transfer functions, respectively.

### Executing program

To get started with using the ERC20 token contract, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Review the Solidity code in the MyToken.sol file to understand its functionalities.
Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler.
Deploy the compiled contract to a test network or the Ethereum mainnet.
Interact with the deployed contract using Ethereum wallets or other tools to mint, burn, and transfer tokens.
